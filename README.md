# 🛳️ Titanic EDA Analysis

## 📘 Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
The aim is to understand the relationships between passenger features and their survival chances.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📊 Steps Performed
1. Imported the Titanic dataset and cleaned missing data.  
2. Explored dataset info and descriptive statistics.  
3. Conducted univariate analysis:
   - Age distribution
   - Survival count
   - Gender distribution
4. Conducted bivariate analysis:
   - Survival by gender
   - Survival by class
   - Fare vs Age scatterplot
   - Correlation heatmap
5. Visualized insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

## 📈 Key Insights
- Females and 1st class passengers had higher survival rates.
- Higher fare = greater chance of survival.
- Most passengers were male, aged between 20–40.
